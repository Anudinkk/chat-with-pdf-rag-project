# Stage 1: Build the React application
FROM node:20-alpine AS build

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application source code
COPY . .

# Build the application for production
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve the application using Nginx
FROM nginx:1.25-alpine AS final

# Copy the built assets from the 'build' stage
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy the custom Nginx config if needed (optional, but good practice)
# COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose port 80 for Nginx
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
